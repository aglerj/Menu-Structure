# Menu Structure for Corona SDK Games (or apps)
## Code is completely free of game logic or 'examples' of logic

A generic menu structure for laying out menus in your games, with a main menu (index.lua), level selection (selectlevel.lua) and example level(level1.lua), etc.

Includes a level reset -without- requiring a new reset lua for each level.

If you've completed the CheetoMoskeeto Tutorials (http://www.cheetomoskeeto.com/ - amazingly good tutorials, buy the sample code) you should be equiped to jump right into this without any explanation.

Available on github, can see it in this short screencast - http://cornstarchmonsters.com/screencasts/generalmenu/

Uses the director class, and a the reset file is based almost entirely off the level specific resets from Ghosts vs Monsters.
